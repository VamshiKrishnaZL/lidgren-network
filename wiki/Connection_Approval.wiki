#summary Connection approval and hail data
#labels Phase-Implementation

A `NetServer` or `NetPeer` can reject, or approve, connection attempts before the connection is formed (and added to the connections list). 
This is done by enabling the `NetMessageType.ConnectionApproval` type like this:

{{{
myServer.SetMessageTypeEnabled(NetMessageType.ConnectionApproval, true);
}}}

When you enable this type of message you might receive a `ConnectionApproval` message when calling `ReadMessage`, and you can then examine the hail data contained in the NetBuffer returned by the call and the IP of the connecting party. You then have two options:

{{{
senderConnection.Approve();
}}}

... or...

{{{
senderConnection.Disapprove("Bye bye, you cannot connect!");
}}}

You will HAVE to call either of these; or the connection will keep hanging and the connector will eventually time out.

If you do now have the `ConnectionApproval` message type enabled, connections will automatically be approved.
