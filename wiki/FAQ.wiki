=====Q: What's new in this version?=====
A: Most of the code is rewritten from scratch, but the general layout of classes remain the same as the first version. The biggest change is that the library now runs in its own thread, better utilizing todays multicore processors. A few API changes has been done to accomodate this; for example, all the events have been removed. Status changes and debug log messages are delivered using the same mechanism as data retrieval.

Here's a list of things which have been improved:

  * Library runs in separate thread
  * NetPeer class for peer-to-peer networking
  * Increased robustness in high lag, high loss situations
  * Increased robustness/correctness during connecting and disconnecting
  * Extensive internal object pooling to reduce allocations
  * Less allocations during writing/reading messages
  * Faster connection lookup and duplicate detection code
  * Call chain and virtual calls reduced
  * Extended congestion control
  * Better detection and handling of forcibly closed connections
  * Extended statistics
  * Generally leaner and meaner code
