
Improvements over last version of library:

* New delivery type: Reliable sequenced (Lost packets are resent but late arrivals are dropped)
* Disconnects and shutdown requests are now queued properly, so calling shutdown will still send any queued messages
* NetPeerConfiguration immutable properties now locked once NetPeer is initialized
* Messages cannot be send twice by accident
* Impossible to confuse sending and receiving buffers since they're different classes
* No more confusion if user should create a buffer or preallocate and reuse
* Working object pooling/recycling
* Reduced CPU usage and lower latencies (in the <1 ms range, but still) due to better socket polling
* All public members of NetPeer/NetConnection completely thread safe
* Larger number of delivery channels
