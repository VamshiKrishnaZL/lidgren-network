
Completed features:
* Message coalescing
* Peer, connection statistics
* Lag, loss and duplication simulation for testing
* Hail data
* Connection approval
* Throttling
* Clock synchronization to detect jitter per packet (NetTime.RemoteNow)

Missing features:
* Message fragmentation 50% done
* Receipts 25% done, need design
* Server discovery, incl. appending data to responses
* Resending of lost handshake (connect/response/established) packets

Things to check/fix:
* Make sure multiple Start(), Shutdown() works correctly
* Sometimes keepalive is sent immediately
